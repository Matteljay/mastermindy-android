MasterMindy is based on Mastermind, a turn-based code breaking game. The app will generate a secret code for you to deduce.
You will only receive minimal hints. A black hint means you positioned a pawn perfectly... but which one? A white hint
means one of your selected pawns is correct but in the wrong place. Play alone or with friends to try and solve this puzzle.
You can easily change the difficulty on the settings page.
